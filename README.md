# Machine Learning | Predicting Worker's Productivity

This prediction project combined business intuition with machine learning modeling (Random Forest Regressor and Classifier) to solve a real-world allocation problem. The result is an accurate prediction model and a practical decision-making framework. This ML project demonstrates the power of analytics to generate financial impact on the manufacturing industry.

# Predicting Worker Productivity in the Apparel Manufacturing Industry

## What Was Achieved

Developed a **dual-purpose machine learning solution** that predicts garment workersâ€™ productivity and optimizes worker placement decisions to maximize profitability for two types of clients:

- **Client A:** Pays based on actual productivity ($120 Ã— P)
- **Client B:** Pays a flat fee ($250) **if** productivity exceeds 0.80

By deploying a **Random Forest Regressor** and a **Random Forest Classifier**, the system enables smarter placement decisions, resulting in up to **$9,720 in added profit** compared to random placement.

## Insights

- **Client B (Classification)** benefited the most from ML guidance, with a **profit increase of $9,720** using the model vs. random placement.
- **Client A (Regression)** still saw a **profit lift of $641**, proving model-guided decisions create tangible value.
- Key predictive features included **idle time**, **incentives**, and **number of workers** â€” revealing how team dynamics and motivation shape productivity.

## Project Description

The garment manufacturing industry is highly labor-intensive, and accurate worker placement is key to operational efficiency. The business challenge was to:

> **Predict individual worker productivity** and **decide if/where to place each worker** to maximize profit for either Client A or Client B.

Using real-world data from the [UCI Garment Worker Productivity dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees), the project simulated a staffing agency making data-driven placement decisions under different client contracts.

## Steps taken to Build the Model & Analyze Data 

### Step 1. Data Preparation
- Removed irrelevant features (`wip`, `date`, `idle_men`)
- Handled missing values (especially in `wip`)
- Applied **one-hot encoding** to categorical variables (`quarter`, `department`, `day`, etc.)
- Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- Defined target variables:
  - `actual_productivity` for regression
  - Binary label (`P > 0.80`) for classification

### Step 2. ðŸ“ˆ Modeling for Client A (Regression)
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance:** RÂ² = **0.443**, lowest MSE among models tested
- **Decision Rule:** Place a worker **only if** `predicted_P Ã— $120 âˆ’ $70 > 0`

### Step 3. ðŸ§  Modeling for Client B (Classification)
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance:**
  - Accuracy = **0.8625**
  - AUC-ROC = **0.9388**
- **Decision Rule:** Place a worker **only if** `P(predicted > 0.8) Ã— $250 âˆ’ $70 > 0`

### Step 4. ðŸ’µ Revenue & Profit Analysis
- **Client A:**
  - Workers placed: 198
  - Total profit: $4,669.10
  - Average profit per placement: $23.58
- **Client B:**
  - Workers placed: 137
  - Total profit: $16,410.00
  - Average profit per placement: $119.78

### Step 5. Random Allocation vs. Model Allocaton Comparison
- **Client A:**
  - Random Profit: $4,027.82
  - Value from Model: **+$641.28**
- **Client B:**
  - Random Profit: $6,690.00
  - Value from Model: **+$9,720.00**
